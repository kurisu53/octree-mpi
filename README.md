# octree-mpi
Serial realization of radius outlier filter for point clouds using octree

Uses RPly library for PLY files reading.
Implements building an octree from a point cloud, finding k nearest neighbors for a given point, radius outlier filtering.

__TODO:__
- Adding writing point cloud data to PLY files
- Implementing statistical outlier filter for point clouds
- Adding point cloud visualization
- Overall optimizing & refactoring
